        <h2><span lang="en-ca">Customer Feedback</span></h2>
        <blockquote>"I want to give a big shout-out to Mr. Rai for finding me the perfect tiny house in Alexandria. I know it wasn't his usual practice area, but he was willing to drive there for a showing and we closed that day! I was very picky with what I wanted, because I am an eco-lover, so I needed a tiny house that was off the grid completely. Mr. Rai knew just the location to look for, and he found a seller that just renovated their water filtration system. I couldn't be happier." - Gabriella Nunes</blockquote>
    
        <blockquote>"Anup helped our family find our first home in Canada after we immigrated from Nepal. We were looking for a house that had enough frooms for our children, and wanted to be close to the train station. Anup helped us find a house in Brampton that was near a supermarket, bus stops, and was in a quiet neighbourhood close to a school. He helped us negotiate the offer within our price range, and helped with the paperwork involved to buy a house in Canada. I am happy to live here thanks to Anup." - Kiran Pandey</blockquote>
    
        <blockquote>"Thank you to Royal Lepage for assigning Anup Rai to be my listing agent. I was able to sell my house smoothly because the agent was very professional. He scheduled the guests for open houses in advance and made sure the property was spotless when he came and left. My favourite part of the experience was having dinner with Anup after we sold the house together, he was a true gentleman." - Amanda Tisdale</blockquote>
